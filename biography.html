        <p>Hey, like you can see I’m not the typical type of guy you see with a camera! I love to travel in America,
            especially in the South. Born and raised by all my brothers and sisters, a tourist left his camera near our
            stash. Since that day I developed a real passion for photography and now I want to share it with people !
            I love to travel and discover new places, meet new people, habitat and cities. That was my dream when I was
            younger and now it became reality. It’s a pleasure to have this opportunity and to share it with you.
            Have fun browsing my site, made with all my little heart !
